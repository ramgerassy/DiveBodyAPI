A backend REST API for managing and logging scuba dives — inspired by my love for the ocean and built from scratch as part of a hands-on learning journey.

DiveBuddyAPI is built with Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. It's powered by modern infrastructure (Docker, AWS), tested with Jest, and structured with scalable backend principles.
